# Sass Tutorial

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is a CSS extension that compiles to CSS. It adds variables, loops, inheritance and many other extras to CSS.

## To get started using Sass

1. Windows users will need to download [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/) by clicking on the download link on the page.

2. Windows and Mac users will run `gem install sass` in terminal or command line. If that doesn't work `sudo gem install sass`.

3. Linux users run `sudo su -c "gem install sass"`.

3. To have syntax highlighting in Sublime, users need to install Sass from Sublime Packages, since Sublime does not automatically have highlighting for Sass.

4. To run Sass in the terminal `sass --watch scss:css`. Running `sass --help` prints a list of options.
